# MATLAB Localization Toolkit
## Description

This is the first step to verify the correct functionality of new algorithms. 

It would be nice to have a receiver structure written in Matlab without using Simulink. 

## Structure

packages --> Useful functions: visualization, tracking, acquisition... fucntions.

systems --> Main applications.

Matlab_Plot_Codes --> Plotting.

### Notes

* Still working on this.
