# TRIPLE-T TEAM

Welcome! Before starting we want to say that there are
still a lot of things to do in this project. The idea is 
to keep improving and learn a lot in the meantime.

## TOPIC

A DOA and RSS-based Localization Radio System with a CPW-Fed Monopole Array Antenna at the ISM 5.8 GHz Band

## Topics included
	- Antenna Theory
	- Analog Design (RF components development)
	- Hardware Design (FPGAs)
	- Algorithm Development (1. MATLAB, 2. Software Application, 
		3. Hardware Design in FPGA, if possible)
	- Software Applications (from device drivers to GUIs)
	- ...

## Project Structure
